		<p>Girls Who Code at Georgia Tech is a club of female computer scientists passionate about empowering young
            women interested in STEM. Our goal is to facilitate the learning of young women who come to us by teaching
            as many coding concepts as possible through various exercises. Every weekend our activities are a choice of
            conversations about stem, highlight videos of incredibly empowering women, projects that strongly focus on
            computer science, and field trips to companies. We welcome young women from middle school to high school
            with any level of skillsets!
